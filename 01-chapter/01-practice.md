# Practice problems
## 1.1

a)

1500 km / 2500 km = 0.6 = 60% of the trip has gained a speedup

Montana = 15 hours
The rest = 10 hours

---

Speedup (S) = T_old / T_new
S = 1 / (0.4 + (0.6/1.5)) = 1 / 1.3 = 0.8

0.8*25 hours = 20 hours new time total

25 / 20 = 1,25 x faster

b)

1,67 = 25 / x
x = 25 / 1.67 = 14.9 hours new time total

14.9 - 10 = 4.9 hours is the new time through Montana

1500km / 4.9 h = 306 km/h

## 1.2

2 = 1 / (0.2 + 0.8/k)
2(0.2 + 0.8/k) = 1
0.4 + 1.6/k = 1
1.6/k = 0.6
1.6 = 0.6k
k = 2.67

We must increase the 80% part 2.67x to achieve an overall speedup of 2x.
